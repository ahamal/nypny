Plea for Help for Nepal Earthquake Victims

You might be already aware of the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal in the morning of April 25. Until now more than 4,000 people have been confirmed dead, and the casualty is expected to go up. Thousands of injured are in desperate need of medical attention. Countless have lost their homes and are literally on street in need of food, warm clothes and medicines. Organizations like Red Cross, MSF/Doctors without Borders, HelpNepal, Non Resident Nepalese USA, and Computer Association Nepal (CAN) are on the ground with supplies and volunteers but it is no match to the devastation the earthquake has left behind. We may not share the victimâ€™s anguish but we can help to alleviate it.

We are currently working to get accurate information from Kathmandu (the capital) and worstaffected areas like Gorkha and Dhading where resources are even more scanty. The scare from aftershocks is hindering local grassroots organizations from being active in relief efforts in the most affected areas. As soon as we get verifiable information, we will be partnering with vetted local organizations and other institutions to support not just the immediate efforts, but also the intermediate and long-term effects of this disaster.

Nepalese Young Professionals in New York (NYPNY) and Nepali Young Professionals of Greater Boston (NYPGB) request your contribution in this moment of need. We are partnering with Grass Root Movement in Nepal (GMIN), a 501 (C) 3 registered nonprofit organization in the USA, for this fund raise. (More info on GMIN at http://www.gmin.us). 100% of the donations raised from this campaign will be donated to local organizations working directly with the victims in Nepal.
