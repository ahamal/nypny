          On April 25, 2015 Nepal experienced a devastating 7.9 richter scale earthquake. Twenty-four hours later, many significant aftershocks continued to be shake the small nation.  Villages have been wiped out,  3000 people have been confirmed dead, and many more are still trapped beneath the rubble, waiting for help.

          There has been no concrete reports from outside the capital yet. Many of these affected places are remote, and not easily accessible. The little reports we have, is grim. In Kathmandu, millions of people have taken refuge in makeshift camps along the streets. An urgent need for basic necessities such as food, water, and medicine persists at this time.

          The Nepali government is doing what it can. But it is not enough. The government lacks sufficient manpower, technology, and supplies for a disaster of this magnitude. Nepal and the Nepali people need your help. And you can make a big difference.
