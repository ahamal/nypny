          Dear ________,
        </p>
        <p>
          You might be already aware that my country Nepal has been hit by a series of earthquakes past two days. My family is safe but others were not so lucky. The death toll is already near 3000 and is expected to go up as dust settles after this devastation. Thousands have been injured, countless have lost home. The survivors are in need of basic humanitarian help like food, water, warm clothes, tent. There are a number of organizations helping but they need fund to support their mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am making this personal request to you if there is anything our company can do to help those in needs. Literally, every penny counts. It could be donations on the behalf of company, matching employee contribution or just spreading words. I understand there might be limitation because of company policies but I am confident that you would do everything in your power to help my fellow countrymen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also like to send an email to all the employees to spread the word about this anguish my fellow compatriots are facing.I have attached a draft of the help plea with this email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank You.
        </p>
        <p>
          With hope,<br>
          ________
